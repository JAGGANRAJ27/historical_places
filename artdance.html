                <h3>Bharatanatyam: The Poetry of Dance</h3>
                <p class="mt-3">Bharatanatyam is one of the oldest classical dance forms of India, with its roots in
                    the
                    temples of Tamil Nadu. It beautifully combines intricate footwork, expressive gestures, and
                    devotional storytelling. Traditionally performed in temples, it celebrates the divine through
                    its
                    soulful movements and artistic grace.</p>

                <h3>Carnatic Music: The Soul of Tamil Nadu</h3>
                <p class="mt-3">Carnatic music, deeply rooted in Tamil Nadu, is one of the world's oldest classical
                    music traditions. Known for its melodious ragas and rhythmic talas, it is centered on vocal
                    performance, often accompanied by instruments like the veena, mridangam, and violin. Tamil Nadu
                    has
                    been home to legendary composers such as Tyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar, and Shyama Shastri.

                        religious festivals like Thaipusam.</li>

                <p>Tamil Nadu's art forms are a celebration of devotion, tradition, and creativity. From the temple
                    courtyards where Bharatanatyam was born to the vibrant folk stages of Therukoothu, each
                    performance
                    connects the past with the present, leaving audiences spellbound.</p>
